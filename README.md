# TicTacToe
A Tic-Tac-Toe app I made while learning React Native, and TypeScript.

## Development
The app was developed using JavaScript, React Native, and Typescript, and published using Expo.io.

Users' are able to play singleplayer against an AI, or multiplayer against other logged-in users.

To support the multiplayer, I used AWS to create databases holding player and game information.
